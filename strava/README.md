# Strava

The strava package provides a CLI tool for interacting with the strava API.
Further, the package exposes methods that allow you to develop your own ways to interact with the strava API.
If you like, you can also work directly with the swagger api call methods for less abstraction.

For each of these interaction methods you can choose to use to work with the strava api through your own strava api app, or the one cassidy provides.


## IMPORTANT WARNING
You may need to change the `LatLng` struct in the `strava/internal/swagger/model_lat_lng.go` file to be a list of `float32` (or `float64`). It appears that swagger-codegen generates this improperly.
`type LatLng struct {}` is **INCORRECT**.

The file should look like THIS:
```
/*
 * Strava API v3
 *
 * The [Swagger Playground](https://developers.strava.com/playground) is the easiest way to familiarize yourself with the Strava API by submitting HTTP requests and observing the responses before you write any client code. It will show what a response will look like with different endpoints depending on the authorization scope you receive from your athletes. To use the Playground, go to https://www.strava.com/settings/api and change your “Authorization Callback Domain” to developers.strava.com. Please note, we only support Swagger 2.0. There is a known issue where you can only select one scope at a time. For more information, please check the section “client code” at https://developers.strava.com/docs.

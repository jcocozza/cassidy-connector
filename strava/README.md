# Strava

The strava package provides a CLI tool for interacting with the strava API.
Further, the package exposes methods that allow you to develop your own ways to interact with the strava API.

For each of these interaction methods you can choose to use to work with the strava api through your own strava api app, or the one cassidy provides.
